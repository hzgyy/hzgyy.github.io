<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
My name is Yiyang Ge. I am a junior student in Zhejiang University majoring in Automation. I am currently exchanging at Cornell University. My research interests lie in the interplay of Control Theory and Machine Learning. Especially with application in Robotics.

**I am currently looking for summer research opportunity. Please contact me if you think I would be a good fit for an opportunity!**

<strong>Reinforcement Learning Algotithms Implementation</strong>
- This project is part of the course assignments for Cornell CS4756 (Robot Learning) and CS4789 (Introduction to Reinforcement Learning).
- I tackled demo tasks in OpenAI Gym environments, including Cartpole, LunarLander, and Fetch-Reach. I implemented several classic RL algorithms, such as Q-learning, DQN, Policy Gradient (REINFORCE), Actor-Critic (A2C, SAC), DDPG, and more. Additionally, I analyzed the performance of these algorithms.
- Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with Pytorch and Numpy, while also learning to identify common bugs and pitfalls in RL algorithm implementation.
